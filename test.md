#WDIConf2016

##A single-page mobile-optimised conference website
WDIConf2016 was built for WDI8 Melb group project 2.

##Technologies Used
This application was created with the Rails framework for Ruby. We also used HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX, jQuery, Materialize. Mailgun and Stripe were implemented for ticket sale confirmation emails and the payment gateway respectively. We managed team contributions using a standard git flow through github.  

##Approach
We wanted to create a simple look and feel with a design optimised for mobile.

##Description and User Story
The website is a single page application with a responsive layout. The landing page shows a menu, which scrolls down to the respective part of the site. The About page is first up, followed by the conference Location page and then the speakers Schedule page. The speakers page . The Sponsors page comes after the Speakers, and finally the Contact page is last. There is a 'back to top' click button at the bottom right of the last page so that mobile users can easily click to top.

##Problems Encountered
- Git merge conflicts troubleshooting
