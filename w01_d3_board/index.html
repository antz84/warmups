      <p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using new- line characters to separate lines.</p>
      <p>At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character.</p>
      <p>The characters should form a chess board.</p>
      <p>Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>. [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>. [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>. [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>[] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
        <li>. [] [] [] [] [] [] [] []</li>
