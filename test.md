#WDIConf2016

##A single-page mobile-optimised conference website
WDIConf was built for a WDI8 Melb group project.

##Technologies Used
This application was created with the Rails framework for Ruby. We also used HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX, jQuery, Materialize. Mailgun and Stripe were implemented for ticket sale confirmation emails and the payment gateway respectively. We managed team contributions using a standard git flow through github.  

##Approach
We wanted to create a simple look and feel with a design optimised for mobile. Potential WDIConfers can view the speaker lineup and purchase tickets to the event without logging in or signing up.

##Description and User Story
The website is a front-end single page application with a responsive layout. The landing page shows a menu, which scrolls down to the different parts of the site. The About page is at the top, followed by the conference Location page and then the speakers Schedule page. The speakers page expands from the initial . The Sponsors page comes after the Speakers, and finally the Contact page is last. There is a 'back to top' click button at the bottom right of the last page so that mobile users can easily click to top.
