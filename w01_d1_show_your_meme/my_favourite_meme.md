Show Your Meme

Make a folder called show_your_meme and create a markdown file inside it called my_favourite_meme.md.
Use markdown to make an information page about your favourite meme. Make sure you have an image, two types of headings and a list of some sort.
Feel free to structure it and add content as you see fit. -->
