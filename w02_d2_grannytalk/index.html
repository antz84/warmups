      <p>Write a function 'grannyTalk' what takes a question as an argument and returns a string as her response.</p>

      <p>If you talk to Granny normally, she'll reply "SPEAK UP SONNY JIM"</p>

      <p>If you talk to her in ALL CAPS, she'll reply "NO, NOT SINCE 1945"</p>

      <p>The year will be a random year between 1930 and 1950.</p>

      <p>If you say "BYE" to her she'll reply "What's that honey, I didn't hear you.."</p>

      <p>bonus: write an additional function 'grandpaTalk' that when called, will call granny for you and interpret her responses incorrectly by swapping vowels randomly in the words of her responses.</p>

      <p>sample output of grandpaTalk: NO NOT SINCE incorrect year // whats that gunny</p>
